# Image Filter Project

This project demonstrates the use of various CSS filter properties applied to images using HTML and CSS.

## Description

This repository contains an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`style.css`) showcasing different image filter effects applied through CSS. The HTML file creates a grid layout displaying multiple images, and the CSS file provides styling and hover effects to apply different filters to these images on hover.

## Usage

To view the image filter effects, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Hover over each image to see the applied filter effect.

## File Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for displaying images and applying CSS filters.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet file that defines the CSS classes and hover effects for image filters.
- `boy.jpg`: Sample image used in the project.
